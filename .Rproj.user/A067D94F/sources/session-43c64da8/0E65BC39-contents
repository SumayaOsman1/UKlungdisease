# Section 1: UK Lung Deaths


## 1.1 About Dataset

This data set is a total deaths from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma in
the Uk from 1974-1979.

The aim of this project is to use Meta's Prophet forecasting system to
use historical data to predict future trends. I will also be identifying
trends or seasonal patterns in Deaths from lung diseases.

## 1.2 Linear Model

We will firstly use the function `lm` to run a regression.

```{r}
#both sexes
ldeaths.df=data.frame(
    ds=zoo::as.yearmon(time(ldeaths)),
    y=ldeaths
)
ds=zoo::as.yearmon(time(ldeaths))
y=ldeaths
model=lm(y~ds,data=ldeaths.df)
summary(model)
plot(ds,y,type="l")
```

From this plot we can clearly see a significant decrease in Lung disease
from 1974 to 1979. The trend mainly shows a decrease in deaths however
it does tend to rise and fall over the years.

## Comparison between Men and Women

```{R}
fdeaths.df=data.frame(
     ds=zoo::as.yearmon(time(fdeaths)),
     y=fdeaths
 )
mdeaths.df=data.frame(
     ds=zoo::as.yearmon(time(mdeaths)),
     y=mdeaths
 )

#Men
ds=zoo::as.yearmon(time(mdeaths))
y=mdeaths
model=lm(y~ds,data=mdeaths.df)
summary(model)
```

From this summary, we can conclude that the predicted number of deaths decreases by around 70 each month.

```{r}
#Women
ds1=zoo::as.yearmon(time(fdeaths))
y1=fdeaths
model1=lm(y1~ds1,data=fdeaths.df)
summary(model1)
```

From this summary we can conclude that there is a predicted decrease of around 19 deaths each month. (lower than Male predicted decrease  <font size="2">ðŸ’¡).


```{r}
#Plots
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(fdeaths);lines(ds1,fitted(model1),type="l",col="red")
plot(mdeaths);lines(ds,fitted(model),type="l",col="red")

```

The 2 plots highlight a clear difference between the number of deaths
due to lung disease in men and women. Women had a significantly lower
number of deaths in 1974 (around 900) and decreased to around 600 by
1980. However Men in the UK started with a much higher figure (around
2100 deaths) but eventually decreased to around 1400 deaths, which is
still considerably higher than Women. This disparity could result from
lifestyle difference, genetics or other contributing factors.

# Section 2: Prophet forecasting

We will now use Meta's forecasting system , prophet, using the dataset
of total Deaths from both genders `ldeaths` for a period of 2 years, 4
years, 8 years and 30 years.

## 2.1 2 year Forecast
```{r}

ldeaths.df=data.frame(
    ds=zoo::as.yearmon(time(ldeaths)),
    y=ldeaths
)
m=prophet::prophet(ldeaths.df,yearly.seasonality=TRUE,weekly.seasonality=TRUE,daily.seasonality=TRUE)
f=prophet::make_future_dataframe(m,periods=2,freq="year")
p=predict(m,f)
plot(m,p)
```

We can use the function `prophet_plot_components` to view the forecast broken down intro trend, weekly seasonality and yearly seasonality.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
prophet::prophet_plot_components(m, p)
```
The trend confirms the conclusion made by fitting a linear regression in section 2.1, that there has been mainly been a persistent decline in Deaths caused by various Lung Diseases in the UK. 

```{r,warning=FALSE}
prophet::dyplot.prophet(m, p)
```

This interactive plot allows for further specific exploration of the data at certain points in time.

## 2.2 4 year Forecast
```{r}
f1=prophet::make_future_dataframe(m,periods=4,freq="year")
p1=predict(m,f1)
plot(m,p1)
prophet::prophet_plot_components(m, p1)
```

## 2.3 8 year Forecast
```{r}
f2=prophet::make_future_dataframe(m,periods=8,freq="year")
p2=predict(m,f2)
plot(m,p2)
```

## 2.4 30 year Forecast
```{r}
f3=prophet::make_future_dataframe(m,periods=30,freq="year")
p3=predict(m,f3)
plot(m,p3)
```

It's clear from these forecasts that there is general decrease in total deaths in the UK. As we increase the Forecast period, we observe a more substantial drop in deaths, from which we can only assume that it will continue on this trend for the foreseeable future; indicating meaningful changes in societal norms (such as smoking) and quality of healthcare.
